Retro 3D
--------

Retro 3D is a shader that provides low grade 3D graphics,
which resembles the first generation of 3D consoles like
PlayStation and Sega Saturn. Basically, this shader is a
kind of unlit shader, but also reduces the precision of
geometric operations, and cancels the perspective
correction for texture mapping.
